# Menus
Can't escape 2d interfaces even in a 3d world.

This page is a stub, but these are some of the best projects in this space:

# Web2VR
project link: https://github.com/kikoano/web2vr

(confirmed working in A-Frame 1.3.0)

Note: this one is a bit non-standard in implementation, and has some quirks, but is very powerful and probably ideal for creating visually complex custom menus. Here's a glitch showing an attempt at using the project:
https://web2vr-demo.glitch.me/

Here's an issue where the non-standard interface is discussed, and how working around that is proposed: https://github.com/kikoano/web2vr/issues/18

# A-Frame Gui
project link: https://github.com/rdub80/aframe-gui

(Not currently updated for 1.3.0)

This project is probably the most 'A-Frame' native style option, and is a great starting point. It does need some bug fixes, but the code is fairly easy to work with and pull requests should be straightforward. Features powerful font options with troika-text, as well as beveled edges, natively.


# A-Frame Material Collection
project link: https://github.com/the-expanse/aframe-material-collection

Uses material design, and "yoga rendering engine" (see: https://yogalayout.com/). It's a bit old, and documentation is lacking, but still in use and recommended by arpu @ vrland.io. He maintains his own fork here, but it wasn't ready for public consumption at time of writing: https://github.com/vrlandio/aframe-material-collection

# Super-Keyboard
project link: https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-super-keyboard

A classic from supermedium. Allows deep customization, pretty advanced capabilities.

There is also a keyboard demo built-in to a-frame gui, above, but it wasn't component-ized, yet.

# aframe-vartiste-toolkit
project link: https://vartiste.xyz/docs.html

The aframe-vartiste-toolkit is a collection of components developed while creating [VARTISTE](https://vartiste.xyz). There's *a lot* of stuff in there, including many UI components. It can be useful for quickly putting together an icon-button and laser-pointer style interface. However, it's not always easy to pull in only parts of the toolkit.
