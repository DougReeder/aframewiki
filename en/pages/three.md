# This is a stub

Mostly a todo / idea.

Todo: add some resources and some quick overviews to help with mental model of THREE, and then illustrations of how A-Frame works in response to that.

A great way to get started is to take THREE examples and try to replicate them in A-Frame.

One example: make an improvement on the A-Frame line component that can take more than two points, so that you can reduce draw calls.
