# Animation
This is a stub
If you want to keyframe states / transitions, use the built-in aframe `animation` component as described in the [docs]().
If you want to use animations baked into your gltf, use the [animation-mixer](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/loaders) (note that that's a link to the C-Frame version of the component, which is the most up-to-date).
